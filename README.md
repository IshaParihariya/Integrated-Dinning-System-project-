# Integrated Dining System

This repository contains the **Integrated Dining System** project, developed as a classroom and learning project.  
It integrates **C++ Object-Oriented Programming concepts** with a **web-based interface** to simulate a basic dining and food ordering system.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how backend logic written in **C++** can be combined with a **frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
A simple **Python server** is included to support local execution and integration.

## Repository Structure

- `integratedDinningSystem.cpp` – Core C++ program implementing dining system logic  
- `index.html` – Frontend user interface  
- `style.css` – Styling for the web interface  
- `script.js` – JavaScript for interactivity  
- `server.py` – Python server for running the project locally  
- `.vscode/` – VS Code configuration files  
- `.gitignore` – Ignored files for version control  

## Technologies Used

- **C++** – Object-Oriented Programming  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – Frontend interface  
- **Python** – Local server  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control  

## How to Run

### Frontend
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser  

### C++ Backend
```bash
g++ integratedDinningSystem.cpp -o diningSystem
./diningSystem
```
## Features

- C++ OOP-based dining system simulation
- Interactive web interface
- Basic frontend-backend integration
- Modular and extendable project structure

## Purpose

This project is meant for:

- Practicing C++ Object-Oriented Programming
- Understanding frontend and backend integration
- Building a complete mini-project for academic use

## Project Status
- Completed classroom project — further enhancements can be added.
